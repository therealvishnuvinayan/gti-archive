This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment Variables

For AI translation and voice transcription in the project stage chat composer:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

For project asset uploads to AWS S3:

```bash
AWS_REGION=
AWS_S3_BUCKET=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
ASSET_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES=104857600
AWS_S3_TRANSFER_ACCELERATION=false
```

To test faster uploads for global users:

1. Enable Transfer Acceleration on the S3 bucket in AWS Console.
2. Set `AWS_S3_TRANSFER_ACCELERATION=true`.
3. Restart the app.
4. Upload the same file again from stage chat.
5. Compare the browser console timings for:
   - `upload:s3-host`
   - `upload:s3-put`
   - `upload:total`

If acceleration is working, the upload host should change from the regional S3 hostname to the S3 accelerate hostname.
